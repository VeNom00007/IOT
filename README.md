# IOT-ASSIGNMENTS
1. Design a Wireless Sensor network to perform end-to-end data transfer by creating a network topology of 10 Nodes and establish the connection between them and test to check the connection by sending ICMPv6 echo request flows from node-1 through the network to node-10 back with ICMPv6 echo reply flows from node-10 through the network to node-1. Trace the packet queues and analyses the packet flow by creating a file "wsn-ping6.tr". (Hint: Use 6LowPAN Module in NS3 and Validation using Wireshark, Use NetAnim for Visualization).
2. Design a networks to perform end-to-end data transfer of IPv6 Packets over IEEE
802.15.4 Networks? Create a network topology of 10 Nodes and test to check the connection between different two UDP clients and to verify the correctness of the received packets. (Hint: Use 6LowPAN Module in NS3 and Validation using Wireshark, Use NetAnim for Visualization).
3. Design a networks to perform end-to-end data transfer of IPv6 Packets over Bluetooth Low Energy Networks? Create a network topology of 10 Nodes and test to check the connection between different two UDP clients and to verify the correctness of the received packets. (Hint: Use 6LowPAN Module in NS3 and Validation using Wireshark, Use NetAnim for Visualization).
4. Design an IoT Network that consists of three RPL Border Router. Each RPL Border Router has two different edge network and each RPL Border Router is used to connect a regular IP network with a RPL 6LoWPAN edge network. To perform this activity create a network topology of 50 Nodes and establish the connection between them. Display the data and visualize the data (Hint: Contiki OS, Cooja Emulator, and Wireshark and Use Web-Sense Motes and Sky Motes).![4](https://github.com/VeNom00007/IOT/assets/86351950/925b66cb-ea19-492f-8eaa-eac4b21e6734)
5. Design an MQTT-SN that exchanges the messages between the node and the broker of the network. Create a simulation with a RPL Border Router device to connect a regular
IP network with a MQTT-SN network. To perform this activity create a network topology of 50 Nodes and establish the connection between them. Display the data and visualize the data (Hint: Contiki OS, Cooja Emulator, and Wireshark).
6. Design an IoT Network that consists of one RPL Border Router and two different edge network and RPL Border Router is used is used to connect a regular IP network to two RPL 6LoWPAN edge network. Create the first RPL 6LoWPAN edge network with groups of clients UDP or the "sensors" that will send data to the gateway and another RPL 6LoWPAN edge network. Next, create the UDP Server in node.js which is outside of the 6LoWPAN network. Establish UDP communication between network (Groups of Clients) and server that reports every client information to the UDP Server.
7. Design a Wireless Sensor network that generates the data, transmit the data through internet and stores into IoT Cloud. To perform this activity create a network topology of 10 Nodes and establish the connection between them, Display the data and visualize the data (Hint: Contiki OS, Cooja Emulator, and Ubidots).
8. Design an IoT Network that consists of three RPL Border Router. Each RPL Border Router has two different edge network and each RPL Border Router is used to connect a regular IP network with a RPL 6LoWPAN edge network. Store the generated data from the edges devices into IoT Cloud. To perform this activity create a network topology of 10 Nodes and establish the connection between them, Display the data and visualize the data You can pause the simulation and examine the packets and console output at your own pace, simply click the Pause button at the Simulation Control panel. When you are done click Restart. (Hint: Contiki OS, Cooja Emulator, and Ubidots; Use Web-Sense Motes and Sky Motes).
9. Implement the Energy Aware Routing Protocol that use the RPL that reduces energy consumption in a Wireless Sensor Network. Test the IoT model that uses UDP/IP/RPL/6LoWPAN/802.15.4 in a simulated environment. Use ns3 and Cooja simulators/Whitefield Framework. Analyze the Network formation and Dynamics of parent switching behavior of RPL network.
10. Design an LORAWAN wireless sensor network. The following figure shows the LoRaWAN network that contains the sensor on the left is connected to the network server on the right. It sends the sensing data to the Gateway using the LoRa technique over long distance. At the Gateway, a higher-throughput IP network takes over and forwards all the data to the network server. Analyze the performance the LORAWAN networks end-to-end reliability packet delivery ratio. Hint Use NS3
